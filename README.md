### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I teach modelling & systems engineering at [cadCAD Edu](https://cadcad.education/)
- 🎓 My mechatronics engineering thesis: [Baleka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPJ2xJNLG1A) - Is a virtual model a suitable replacement for accurate dynamic modelling in complex robotic topologies?
- ✍️ I write about Systems Engineering at [systemsexplained.com](https://systemsexplained.com)
- ⭐ My favourite programming language is Elixir
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, Machine Learning, all the buzz words

My ideal stack:
- Most productive in: Elixir/Phoenix Framework
- For datascience: Python
- For robust systems & CLIs: Rust
- For mobile applications: Android Native/Kotlin
- For product development: React/Redux/NodeJS/Typescript
- For system infrastructure: Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Nix/NixOS
